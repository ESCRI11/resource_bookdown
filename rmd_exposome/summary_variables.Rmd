Non-disclosive descriptive statistics can be obtained from the exposome dataset, the function `ds.exposome_summary` is in charge of that. It can obtain descriptive statistics from numeric and factor variables of the exposome dataset (both from exposures and phenotypes). 

```{r}
# Numerical variable
ds.exposome_summary("exposome_object", "PM25", conns)
# Factor variable
ds.exposome_summary("exposome_object", "flu", conns)
```
