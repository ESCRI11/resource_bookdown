# OPAL

Opal is [OBiBa](https://www.obiba.org/)’s core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once collected either from OBiBa’s Onyx application, must be integrated and stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central repository. Current Opal version can import, process, and copy data. Opal is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing among biobanks. More information on Opal future can be seen in [Opal description on OBiBa](https://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/).

Initial implementation of Opal was based on managing databases as tables by supporting several data warehouse technologies such as:

  - MongoDB , Mysql , MariaDB  and PostgreSQL  as database software backend,
  - Import data from CSV, SPSS, SAS, Stata files and from SQL databases,
  - Export data to CSV, SPSS, SAS, Stata files and to SQL databases,
  - Connect directly to multiple data source software such as SQL databases and LimeSurvey ,
  - Store data about any type of "entity", such as subject, sample, geographic area, etc.,
  - Store data of any type (e.g., texts, numbers, geo-localisation, images, videos, etc.),
  - Import and store genotype data as VCF files (Variant Call format ),
  - ...


Detailed concepts and tutorials for tables can be found here:

   - [Data Harmonization](http://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/data-harmonization.html)


To have a closer look at Opal with table you can try our demo site:

In this work, we will present a more flexible data infrastructure called [resources](#resources) that will be able to manage Big Data sets which can be a limitation when using tables. 

Before introducing this new feature and in order to make the reader familiar with Opal we recommend to visit [this webpage](https://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/) where a global overview along with some examples are described
