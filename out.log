Reading map (extended format) from [ brge.bim ] 
100000 markers to be included from [ brge.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ brge.fam ] 
2312 individuals read from [ brge.fam ] 
2312 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
725 cases, 1587 controls and 0 missing
1097 males, 1215 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ brge.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 100000 SNPs
2312 founders and 0 non-founders found
6009 heterozygous haploid genotypes; set to missing
Writing list of heterozygous haploid genotypes to [ /tmp/ssh-3050/out.hh ]
7 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ /tmp/ssh-3050/out.nof ]
