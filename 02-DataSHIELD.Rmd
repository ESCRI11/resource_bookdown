# DataSHIELD {#DataSHIELD}

DataSHIELD infrastructure is a software solution that allows simultaneous co-analysis of data from multiple studies stored on different servers without the need to physically pool data or disclose sensitive information. DataSHIELD uses [Opal servers](http://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/) to properly perform such analyses. 

At a high level DataSHIELD is set up as a client-server model which houses the data for a particular study. A request is made from the client to run specific functions on the remote servers where the analysis is performed. Non-sensitive and pre-approved summary statistics are returned from each study to the client where they can be combined for an overall analysis. An overview of what a single-site DataSHIELD architecture would look like is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:dsArchitec).
